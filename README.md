# Introduction
In this project I will use a well known database for pattern recognition exercises, Iris Species. The [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/toy_dataset.html) library comes with a few small standard datasets that do not require to download any file from some external website, including Iris Species. However, to practice basic commands the data was downloaded from the following [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/iris?datasetId=19&sortBy=voteCount).

# Project Content
In this project I have practiced the main steps of the a data science project. I took a simple data set and showed some important steps towards a classification:
1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Correlation
3. Preprocessing and Model Selection
4. Best Model: Logistic Regression Model vs SVM
5. Dimensionality Reduction

Even though it was a simple exercise, this project can be used as a template for more advanced classification challenges.
